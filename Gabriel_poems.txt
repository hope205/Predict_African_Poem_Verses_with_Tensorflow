The Call of the River Nun
Piano’s and drums
Were I to Choose
Spirit of the Wind
New Year’s Eve Midnight
You laughed I laughed
The mystic Drum
One night at victorias’s beach
Adhiambo 
To Paveba
Franvenkirche
The gambler
Initroit 
I hear your call! 
I hear it far away; 
I hear it break the circle of these crouching hills.
I want to view your face again and feel your cold embrace; 
or at your brim to set myself and inhale your breath; 
or like the trees, 
to watch my mirrored self unfold and span my days with song from the lips of dawn.
I hear your lapping call! 
I hear it coming through; 
invoking the ghost of a child 
listening, where river birds hail your silver-surfaced flow.
My river's calling too! 
Its ceaseless flow impels 
my found'ring canoe down 
its inevitable course. 
And each dying year 
brings near the sea-bird call, 
the final call that 
stills the crested waves 
and breaks in two the curtain 
of silence of my upturned canoe.
O incomprehensible God! 
Shall my pilot be 
my inborn stars to that 
final call to Thee. 
O my river's complex course? 
When at break of day at a riverside
I hear jungle drums telegraphing
the mystic rhythm, urgent, raw
like bleeding flesh, speaking of
primal youth and the beginning
I see the panther ready to pounce,
the leopard snarling about to leap
and the hunters crouch with
spears poised;
And my blood ripples, turns torrent,
topples the years and at once I’m
in my mother’s lap a suckling;
at once I’m walking simple
paths with no innovations,
rugged, fashioned with the naked
warmth of hurrying feet and
groping hearts
in green leaves and wild flowers pulsing
Then I hear a wailing piano
solo speaking of complex ways
in tear-furrowed concerto;
of far away lands
and new horizons with
coaxing diminuendo, counterpoint
crescendo. But lost in the labyrinth
of its complexities, it ends in the middle
of a phrase at a daggerpoint.
And I lost in the morning mist
of an age at a riverside keep
wandering in the mystic rhythm
of jungle drums and the concerto.
When Adam broke the stone
and red streams raged down to
gather in the womb,
an angel calmed the storm;
And I, the breath mewed
in Cain, unblinking gaze
at the world without
from the brink of an age
That draws from the groping lips
a breast-muted cry
to thread the years.
(O were I to choose)
And now the close of one
and thirty turns, the world
of bones is Babel, and
the different tongues within
are flames the head
continually burning.
And O of this dark halo
were the tired head free.
And when the harmattan
of days has parched the throat
and skin and sucked the fever
of the head away
Then the massive dark
descends and flesh and bone
are razed. And (O were I to choose) I’d cheat the worms
and silence seek in stone.
The storks are coming now
white specks in the silent sky.
They had gone north seeking
fairer climes to build their homes
when here was raining.
They are back with me now
spirits of the wind,
beyond the gods’ confining hands
they go north and west and east,
instinct guiding.
But willed by the gods
I’m sitting on this rock
watching them come and go
from sunrise to sundown,
with the spirit urging within.
And urging, a red pool stirs,
and each ripple is
the instinct’s vital call,
a desire in a million cells
confined.
O God of the gods and me,
shall I not heed
this prayer-bell call,
the noon angelus,
because my stork is caged
in singed hair and dark skin?
Now the bells are tolling –
a year is dead.
And my heart is slowly beating
the Nunc Dimittis
to all my hopes and mute
yearnings of a new year.
And ghosts hover round
dream beyond dream
Dream beyond dream
mingling with the brightest gleam.
Bell-sounds fading
into memories
like rain drops
falling into a river.
And now the bells are chiming –
a year is born.
And my heart-bell is ringing in a dawn.
But it’s shrouded things I see
dimly stride
on heart-canopied paths
to a riverside.
In your ears my song is motor car misfiring stopping with a choking cough; 
and you laughed and laughed and laughed.
In your eyes my ante- natal walk was inhuman, 
passing your "omnivorous understanding" and you laughed and laughed and laughed
You laughed at my song, you laughed at my walk.
Then I danced my magic dance to the rhythm of talking drums pleading, 
but you shut your eyes and laughed and laughed and laughed
And then I opened my mystic inside wide like the sky, 
instead you entered your car and laughed and laughed and laughed
You laughed at my dance, you laughed at my inside. 
You laughed and laughed and laughed.
But your laughter was ice-block laughter and it froze your inside froze your voice froze your ears froze your eyes and froze your tongue.
And now it’s my turn to laugh; but my laughter is not ice-block laughter. 
For I know not cars, know not ice-blocks.
My laughter is the fire of the eye of the sky, the fire of the earth, 
the fire of the air, the fie of the seas and the rivers fishes animals trees and it thawed your inside, 
thawed your voice, thawed your ears, thawed your eyes and thawed your tongue.
So a meek wonder held your shadow and you whispered; 
"Why so?" And I answered: 
"Because my fathers and I are owned by the living warmth of the earth through our naked feet."
The mystic drum in my inside
and fishes danced in the rivers
and men and women danced on land
to the rhythm of my drum 
But standing behind a tree
with leaves around her waist
she only smiled with a shake of her head. 
Still my drum contimued to beat,
rippling the air with quickened
tempo compelling the quick
and the dead to dance and sing
with their shadows - 
But standing behind a tree
with leaves around her waist
she only smiled with a shake of her head. 
Then the drum beat with the rhythm
of the things of the ground
and invoked the eye of the sky
the sun and the moon and the river gods -
and the trees bean to dance,
the fishes turned men
and men turned fishes
and things stopped to grow - 
But standing behind a tree
with leaves around her waist
she only smiled with a shake of her head. 
And then the mystic drum
in my inside stopped to beat -
and men became men,
fishes became fishes
and trees, the sun and the moon
found their places, and the dead
went to the ground and things began to grow.
And behind the tree she stood
with roots sprouting from her
feet and leaves growing on her head
and smoke issuing from her nose
and her lips parted in her smile
turned cavity belching darkness.
Then, then I packed my mystic drum
and turned away; never to beat so loud any more.
On the beach at night,
Stands a child with her father,
Watching the east, the autumn sky.
Up through the darkness,
While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading,
Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky,
Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east,
Ascends large and calm the lord-star Jupiter,
And nigh at hand, only a very little above,
Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades.
From the beach the child holding the hand of her father,
Those burial-clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all,
Watching, silently weeps.
Weep not, child,
Weep not, my darling,
With these kisses let me remove your tears,
The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious,
They shall not long possess the sky, they devour the stars only in apparition,
Jupiter shall emerge, be patient, watch again another night, the Pleiades shall emerge,
They are immortal, all those stars both silvery and golden shall shine out again,
The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again, they endure,
The vast immortal suns and the long-enduring pensive moons shall again shine.
Then dearest child mournest thou only for Jupiter?
Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?

Something there is,
(With my lips soothing thee, adding I whisper,
I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,)
Something there is more immortal even than the stars,
(Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,)
Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter
Longer than sun or any revolving satellite,
Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades.
I hear many voices 
like it’s said a madman hears; 
I hear trees talking 
like it’s said a medicine man hears. 
Maybe I’m a madman, 
I’m a medicine man. 
Maybe I’m mad, 
for the voices are luring me, 
urging me from the midnight 
moon and the silence of my desk 
to walk on wave crests across a sea. 
Maybe I am a medicine man 
hearing talking saps, 
seeing behind trees; 
but who’s lost his powers 
of invocation. 
But the voices and the trees are 
now name-spelling and one figure 
silence-etched across 
the moonface is walking, stepping 
over continents and seas. 
And I raised my hand –– 
my trembling hand, gripping 
my heart as handkerchief 
and waved and waved –– and waved –– 
but she turned her eyes away. 
When young fingers stir
the fire smoldering in my inside
the dead weight of dead years rolls
crashing to the ground
and the fire begins to flame anew,
The fire begins to flame anew
devouring the debris of years –
the dry harmattan-sucked trees,
the dry tearless faces
smiling weightless smiles like breath
that do not touch the ground.
The fire begins to flame anew
and I laugh and shout to the eye
of the sky on the back of a fish
and I stand on the wayside
smiling the smile of budding trees
at men and women whose insides
are filled with ashes, who
tell me, “We once had our flaming fire.”
Then I remember my vow.
I remember my vow not to let
my fire flame any more. And the dead
years rise creaking from the ground
and file slowly into my inside
and shyly push aside the young fingers
and smother the devouring flame.
And as before the fire smolders in water,
continually smoldering beneath
the ashes with things I dare not tell
erupting from the hackneyed lore
of the beginning. For they die in the telling.
I am standing on an age which is now
an object of curiosity and wonder
and which has withstood centuries
and perfected means of destruction
I am indeed standing on Faith
absolute Faith, twin-towered Faith
in which echoes of whispered prayers
clinging to the walls give one a feeling
strange yet not strange. A feeling
which knows no language no creed
and running through my inside
to my hands made them one
with those that set brick upon brick
to build this memorial, this symbol of Faith
and landmark to this city of Munich
I opened my palm wide,
my fingers pointing into five directions,
then I placed the dice
on the geometrical center
and closed my palm with prayers
from five directions invoking
CHANCE for SIX!
Then I brought it near to my lips
and gave it teaching words;
I brought it near my lips
and blew my breath on it;
I brought it near my lips
and prayed to LUCK for SIX!
Then with my sweating shadow
and my trembling inside dripping
with emotions, I shook the dice
over my head seven times and shutting
my eyes let it drop from my palm!
I slowly opened my eyes
and saw the dice suspended
between earth and sky, dancing,
before my eyes and a hand reached
down from the sky and snatched it away!
Cast your net to the rightside
Nothing?
Nothing
Cast it to the leftside
Nothing?
Nothing
Then cast it to the back of the canoe
and draw gently and carefully
while I paddle the canoe forward-
Nothing?
It’s only the Back caught
in the meshes of Today
and I see past moons past suns
past nights and past gods reflected
by the Back trying to slip
through the Meshes like a fish
Draw gently
draw carefully
don’t let it slip
draw it up into
the canoe and let’s hold
it in our palms
the Back, the gods,
even for only
one still moment
one still moment
one teaching moment
